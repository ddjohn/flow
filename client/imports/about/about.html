<h4>The Road Not Taken</h4>
<p> 
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br/>
And sorry I could not travel both<br/>
And be one traveler, long I stood<br/>
And looked down one as far as I could<br/>
To where it bent in the undergrowth;
</p>
<p> 
Then took the other, as just as fair,<br/>
And having perhaps the better claim,<br/>
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br/>
Though as for that the passing there<br/>
Had worn them really about the same,
</p>
<p> 
And both that morning equally lay<br/>
In leaves no step had trodden black.<br/>
Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br/>
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br/>
I doubted if I should ever come back.
</p>
<p> 
I shall be telling this with a sigh<br/>
Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br/>
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—<br/>
I took the one less traveled by,<br/>
And that has made all the difference.
</p>
<i>Robert Frost</i>

<h4>Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?</h4>
<p>
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?<br/>
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.<br/>
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<br/>
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
</p>
<p>
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,<br/>
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;<br/>
And every fair from fair sometime declines,<br/>
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
</p>
<p>
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,<br/>
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,<br/>
Nor shall death brag thou wand’rest in his shade,<br/>
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow’st.
</p>
<p>
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,<br/>
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
</p>
<i>William Shakespeare</i>

<h4>A Dream Within a Dream</h4>
<p>
Take this kiss upon the brow!<br/>
And, in parting from you now,<br/>
Thus much let me avow —<br/>
You are not wrong, who deem<br/>
That my days have been a dream;<br/>
Yet if hope has flown away<br/>
In a night, or in a day,<br/>
In a vision, or in none,<br/>
Is it therefore the less gone?<br/>  
All that we see or seem<br/>
Is but a dream within a dream.
</p>
<p>
I stand amid the roar<br/>
Of a surf-tormented shore,<br/>
And I hold within my hand<br/>
Grains of the golden sand —<br/>
How few! yet how they creep<br/>
Through my fingers to the deep,<br/>
While I weep — while I weep!<br/>
O God! Can I not grasp <br/>
Them with a tighter clasp?<br/>
O God! can I not save<br/>
One from the pitiless wave?<br/>
Is all that we see or seem<br/>
But a dream within a dream?
</p>
<i>Edgar Allan Poe</i>
